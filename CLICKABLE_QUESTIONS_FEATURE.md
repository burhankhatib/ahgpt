# Clickable Questions Feature

## Technical Implementation

### AI Response Format
The AI is instructed to format questions using specific HTML structure:

```html
<div class="suggested-questions">
    <h4>Continue the conversation:</h4>
    <div class="question-item" data-question="Question text here">1. Question text here</div>
    <div class="question-item" data-question="Another question">2. Another question</div>
    <div class="question-item" data-question="Third question">3. Third question</div>
</div>
```

### HTML Formatting Enforcement
The system prompt includes strict HTML formatting rules:
- **No Markdown**: Explicitly prohibits markdown code blocks like \`\`\`html
- **Pure HTML**: All content must be in HTML format without markdown wrappers
- **Rich Formatting**: Uses proper HTML tags for all formatting needs
- **Consistent Structure**: Enforces exact HTML structure for questions

### Frontend Processing
The chat page processes these HTML structures and converts them to clickable elements:

```typescript
const processMessageContent = (content: string) => {
    // Remove any markdown code blocks that might slip through
    const processedContent = content
        .replace(/```html\s*/g, '')
        .replace(/```\s*/g, '')
        .replace(/`{3,}/g, '');
    
    const suggestedQuestionsRegex = /<div class="suggested-questions">([\s\S]*?)<\/div>/g;
    return processedContent.replace(suggestedQuestionsRegex, (match, innerContent) => {
        // Extract and convert questions to clickable format
        // Returns enhanced HTML with click handlers
    });
};
```

### Fallback Mechanism
The system includes robust fallback handling:

```typescript
// Primary: Extract properly formatted questions
let questionMatches = innerContent.match(/<div class="question-item" data-question="([^"]*)"[^>]*>([^<]*)<\/div>/g);

// Fallback: Extract numbered questions even if not in exact format
if (!questionMatches) {
    const numberedQuestions = innerContent.match(/\d+\.\s*([^<\n]+)/g);
    if (numberedQuestions) {
        questionMatches = numberedQuestions.map((q: string, index: number) => {
            const questionText = q.replace(/^\d+\.\s*/, '').trim();
            return `<div class="question-item" data-question="${questionText}">${index + 1}. ${questionText}</div>`;
        });
    }
}
```

### Click Handler Implementation
```typescript
const handleQuestionClick = (questionText: string) => {
    if (isLoading) return; // Prevent clicks during loading
    
    setInput(questionText);
    
    // Auto-submit the form
    setTimeout(() => {
        const form = inputRef.current?.closest('form');
        if (form) {
            form.dispatchEvent(new Event('submit', { bubbles: true, cancelable: true }));
        }
    }, 100);
};
```

### CSS Styling System
